ðŸš€ Built a Real-Time Streaming Analytics Pipeline with Databricks DLT

What I built:
Bronze Layer: Auto-generated streaming events (clicks, purchases, views)
Silver Layer: Data cleaning + validation with quality expectations
Gold Layer: Business metrics and analytics dashboards
Key Features: âœ… Real-time data processing with Spark Structured Streaming âœ… Multi-layered medallion architecture (Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold) âœ… Data quality rules using DLT expectations âœ… Interactive dashboards with metrics on revenue, users, and performance âœ… Aggregations by country, traffic source, device type, and products
Tech Stack: PySpark | Delta Live Tables | Databricks | SQL | Data Visualization
The dashboard shows live insights including:
$2.45M total revenue tracked
2.8K unique users
Performance breakdown by geography, traffic sources, and devices
Product-level analytics
This project demonstrates end-to-end data engineering - from raw streaming data to actionable business insights.
